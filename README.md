# VoiceCipher 🎙️
Local Speech transcription using Tiny Whisper model

Welcome to **VoiceCipher**,it is a backend system designed to securely process voice data using ML-based transcription models. It focuses on backend-driven architecture to convert voice to text, securely handle data, and build modular audio-processing pipelines — demonstrating principles that apply to financial systems, fraud detection, secure transactions, and real-time verification systems.


## Features 🌟

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless experience. 🎨
- **Flexible Input Options**: Transcribe from URLs, file uploads, or direct recordings. 🔗📁🎤
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Convert your voice recordings into text using state-of-the-art ML models. 🧠
- **Secure voice data pipeline**: Ensures all audio data is processed and transmitted with encryption for end-to-end security. 🔒
- **Modular backend architecture**: Clean separation of concerns allows easy extension, scaling, and system upgrades. 🏗️
- **Audio file ingestion & transcription**: Handles multiple input formats and seamlessly converts speech to text. 🎙️📝
- **Stateless backend design**: Highly scalable design that allows distributed deployment without session dependencies. ⚙️
- **Secure storage & transmission design**: Protects sensitive data both at rest and during transmission. 🔐
- **Ready for integration into payment or identity verification systems**: Can be adapted for secure KYC, payment verification, or fraud detection modules. 💳🔎


## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with VoiceCipher Secure Backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

bash
```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-Himanshu19/voicecipher-secure-communication.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd voicecipher-secure-communication
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Start the Backend Server**

```bash
npm start
```

5. **Access Locally**
Open your browser or API client and connect to the provided local URL.


## Usage 🛠️
1. **Choose Your Input Method**:
   - **From URL**: Enter the URL of the audio file. 🌐
   - **From File**: Upload an audio file from your computer. 📁
   - **Record**: Record audio directly through your microphone. 🎤
   - The system accepts voice/audio input via APIs or file uploads.

2. **Transcribe**: Click the "Transcribe" button to start converting your audio into text.✏️
                   Audio is processed and transcribed to text using Whisper-based models.


4. **View Results**: The transcription will appear in the text area below the buttons. Note that it is currently limited to 20 seconds for most devices; improvements are planned.⏱️
                     Backend service can be integrated into secure transaction systems, payment verification, or identity authentication.


## How It Works 🔍
Backend-Driven Processing:
Audio files are handled and processed on secure backend servers to maintain data privacy, compliance, and full control over the processing pipeline. 🔒

Transformer.js Integration:
Uses transformers.js library to run Whisper models for real-time speech-to-text conversion within backend services. 🧠

Static Execution (No WebAssembly Dependency):
The Whisper model is executed without WebAssembly, simplifying deployment and improving cross-platform compatibility. ⚙️

Secure Data Flow:
Implements encryption for secure data transmission and storage, ensuring end-to-end protection of sensitive audio data. 🔐

Extensible Backend Architecture:
Clean modular design allows for easy scaling, microservice integration, and deployment across multiple environments (cloud, on-premise, edge devices). 🏗️

Payment System Integration Ready:
The architecture can be directly adapted for secure KYC, payment verification, fraud detection, and identity management workflows. 💳




## Dependencies 📦
-- **Node.js & Express:** Backend server framework.
-- **Transformer.js (Xenova):** Speech recognition via Whisper model,for speech recognition. 🧠
-- **CryptoJS:** For secure encryption and decryption modules.
-- **Bootstrap:** For simple frontend demo interface,styling. 🎨


## Future Extensions 🚧
1.Scalable deployment using Docker & Kubernetes.
2.Secure API Gateway integrations.
3.Multilingual transcription capabilities.
4.Microservice design for real-time streaming transcription.
5.Compliance-ready design for payment systems (PCI-DSS alignment).
6.Adding support for audio clips longer than 20 seconds for all devices.
7.Adding a multilingual model to transcribe various languages, like Telugu. 🌍

# VoiceCipher 🎙️
Local Speech transcription using Tiny Whisper model

Welcome to **VoiceCipher**,it is a backend system designed to securely process voice data using ML-based transcription models. It focuses on backend-driven architecture to convert voice to text, securely handle data, and build modular audio-processing pipelines — demonstrating principles that apply to financial systems, fraud detection, secure transactions, and real-time verification systems.


## Features 🌟

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless experience. 🎨
- **Flexible Input Options**: Transcribe from URLs, file uploads, or direct recordings. 🔗📁🎤
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Convert your voice recordings into text using state-of-the-art ML models. 🧠
- **Secure voice data pipeline**: Ensures all audio data is processed and transmitted with encryption for end-to-end security. 🔒
- **Modular backend architecture**: Clean separation of concerns allows easy extension, scaling, and system upgrades. 🏗️
- **Audio file ingestion & transcription**: Handles multiple input formats and seamlessly converts speech to text. 🎙️📝
- **Stateless backend design**: Highly scalable design that allows distributed deployment without session dependencies. ⚙️
- **Secure storage & transmission design**: Protects sensitive data both at rest and during transmission. 🔐
- **Ready for integration into payment or identity verification systems**: Can be adapted for secure KYC, payment verification, or fraud detection modules. 💳🔎


## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with VoiceCipher Secure Backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

bash
```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-Himanshu19/voicecipher-secure-communication.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd voicecipher-secure-communication
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Start the Backend Server**

```bash
npm start
```

5. **Access Locally**
Open your browser or API client and connect to the provided local URL.


## Usage 🛠️
1. **Choose Your Input Method**:
   - **From URL**: Enter the URL of the audio file. 🌐
   - **From File**: Upload an audio file from your computer. 📁
   - **Record**: Record audio directly through your microphone. 🎤
   - The system accepts voice/audio input via APIs or file uploads.

2. **Transcribe**: Click the "Transcribe" button to start converting your audio into text.✏️
                   Audio is processed and transcribed to text using Whisper-based models.


4. **View Results**: The transcription will appear in the text area below the buttons. Note that it is currently limited to 20 seconds for most devices; improvements are planned.⏱️
                     Backend service can be integrated into secure transaction systems, payment verification, or identity authentication.


## How It Works 🔍

- **Backend-Driven Processing:** Audio files are securely handled and processed on the backend to ensure privacy, compliance, and full control. 🔒  
- **Transformer.js Integration:** Uses the transformers.js library to run Whisper models for real-time speech-to-text conversion within backend services. 🧠  
- **Static Execution (No WebAssembly Dependency):** Executes the Whisper model without relying on WebAssembly, making deployment simpler and highly portable across different platforms. ⚙️  
- **Secure Data Flow:** Ensures end-to-end encryption for safe transmission and storage of sensitive audio data. 🔐  
- **Extensible Backend Architecture:** Modular design allows for scalable deployment, easy microservice integration, and multi-environment support (cloud, on-premise, edge devices). 🏗️  
- **Payment System Integration Ready:** Can be extended into secure payment verification, KYC, fraud detection, and identity management systems. 💳



## Dependencies 📦
- **Node.js & Express:** Backend server framework.
- **Transformer.js (Xenova):** Speech recognition via Whisper model,for speech recognition. 🧠
- **CryptoJS:** For secure encryption and decryption modules.
- **Bootstrap:** For simple frontend demo interface,styling. 🎨


## Future Extensions 🚧

- **Scalable Deployment:** Easily deployable using Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration for horizontal scaling. 📦⚙️  
- **Secure API Gateway Integrations:** Capable of integrating with secure API Gateways for external system interoperability and traffic management. 🔐🌐  
- **Multilingual Transcription Capabilities:** Extendable to support multiple languages beyond English, enabling global use cases. 🌎🗣️  
- **Microservice Design for Streaming:** Real-time transcription pipeline using microservice architecture for low-latency processing. ⏱️🧩  
- **Compliance-Ready (PCI-DSS):** Architecture designed for integration with payment systems, ensuring regulatory and security compliance. 💳📑  
- **Extended Audio Duration:** Ability to process longer audio clips, removing the current 20-second limitation. ⏳🎙️  
- **Regional Language Support:** Expand transcription models to handle regional languages like Telugu, Hindi, etc. 🌍🗣️
